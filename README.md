# CPR Tools Hash Checker

This is a program that I created for my company in order to hash a directory and its sub-folders so that the contents can be verified later using a .hash file.

## Usage

**In File Path:**

This is the directory you wish to generate a hash from or compare with a hash.

**Hash File Save Directory**

This is the directory where your generated hash file will be stored.

**Out File Directory**

This is where the results of the hash check and where the matched and mismatched files will be copied to if applicable.

**Hash File Path**

The location of your generated hash file which you wish to compare your directory to.

**Do Copy**

Selecting this option will copy the matched and mismatched files to to the out file directory in their own respective folders.
